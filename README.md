## Introduction

Zerobyte is a backup automation tool that helps you save your data across multiple storage backends. Built on top of Restic, it provides an modern web interface to schedule, manage, and monitor encrypted backups of your remote storage.

## Documentation

The official documentation website is available at [zerobyte.app](https://zerobyte.app).

It contains up-to-date setup guides, configuration reference, and usage documentation for running Zerobyte in production.

### Features

- **Automated backups** with encryption, compression, and retention policies, powered by Restic
- **Flexible scheduling** for automated backup jobs with fine-grained retention policies
- **End-to-end encryption** will ensure your data is always protected
- **Multi-protocol support** for backup from NFS, SMB, WebDAV, SFTP, or local directories

## Installation

In order to run Zerobyte, you need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your server. Then, you can use the provided `compose.yaml` file to start the application.

```yaml
services:
  zerobyte:
    image: ghcr.io/nicotsx/zerobyte:v0.43
    container_name: zerobyte
    restart: unless-stopped
    stop_grace_period: 30s
    cap_add:
      - SYS_ADMIN
    ports:
      - "4096:4096"
    devices:
      - /dev/fuse:/dev/fuse
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Zurich # Set your timezone here
      - BASE_URL=http://localhost:4096 # URL you will use to access Zerobyte
      - APP_SECRET=94bad46...c66e25d5c2b # Generate your own secret with `openssl rand -hex 32`
    volumes:
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      - /var/lib/zerobyte:/var/lib/zerobyte
```

> [!WARNING]
> It is highly discouraged to run Zerobyte on a server that is accessible from the internet (VPS or home server with port forwarding). If you do, make sure to change the port mapping to "127.0.0.1:4096:4096" and use a secure tunnel (SSH tunnel, Cloudflare Tunnel, etc.) with authentication.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not try to point `/var/lib/zerobyte` to a network share. You will face permission issues and strong performance degradation.

> [!NOTE]
> **TrueNAS Users:** The host path `/var/lib` is ephemeral on TrueNAS and will be reset during system upgrades. Instead of using `/var/lib/zerobyte:/var/lib/zerobyte`, create a dedicated ZFS dataset (e.g., `tank/docker/zerobyte`) and mount it instead:
>
> ```yaml
> volumes:
>   - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
>   - /mnt/tank/docker/zerobyte:/var/lib/zerobyte
> ```
>
> This ensures your configuration, encryption keys, and database persist across TrueNAS upgrades.

Then, run the following command to start Zerobyte:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Once the container is running, you can access the web interface at `http://<your-server-ip>:4096`.

## Configuration

Zerobyte can be customized using environment variables. Below are the available options:

### Environment variables

| Variable                  | Description                                                                                                                               | Default                |

| `PORT`                    | The port the web interface and API will listen on.                                                                                        | `4096`                 |
| `RESTIC_HOSTNAME`         | The hostname used by Restic when creating snapshots. Automatically detected if a custom hostname is set in Docker.                        | `zerobyte`             |
| `GOMAXPROCS`              | Optional positive integer passed to Restic processes to limit CPU scheduler threads. Useful for reducing CPU pressure during backups.     | Restic default         |
| `TZ`                      | Timezone for the container (e.g., `Europe/Zurich`). **Crucial for accurate backup scheduling.**                                           | `UTC`                  |
| `TRUST_PROXY`             | When `true`, trust an existing `X-Forwarded-For` header from your reverse proxy. Leave `false` for direct deployments.                    | `false`                |
| `TRUSTED_ORIGINS`         | Comma-separated list of extra trusted origins for CORS (e.g., `http://localhost:3000,http://example.com`).                                | (none)                 |
| `WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated list of HTTP origins allowed for backup webhooks and outbound HTTP notification destinations.                             | (none)                 |
| `WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT`         | Timeout for backup webhook requests in seconds.                                                                                           | `60`                   |
| `LOG_LEVEL`               | Logging verbosity. Options: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.                                                                             | `info`                 |
| `RCLONE_CONFIG_DIR`       | Path to the directory containing `rclone.conf` inside the container. Change this if running as a non-root user.                           | `/root/.config/rclone` |
| `PROVISIONING_PATH`       | Path to a JSON file with operator-managed repositories and volumes to sync at startup.                                                    | (none)                 |

### Performance tuning

If backups use too much CPU, set `GOMAXPROCS` on the Zerobyte container and restart it:

```yaml
environment:
  - GOMAXPROCS=2
```

This limits the Go scheduler used by Restic child processes. Existing operations are not changed; the new value applies to Restic processes started after the container restart.

Other useful Restic tuning options:

- Set repository compression to `off` to reduce CPU usage, or `auto` for the usual balance. `max` can save more space but uses more CPU.
- Use repository upload/download limits to avoid saturating network links.
- Use backup schedule **Custom restic parameters** for advanced per-job flags such as `--read-concurrency 1`, `--exclude-larger-than 10G`, or `--no-scan`.

See the full guide: [Performance tuning](https://zerobyte.app/docs/guides/performance-tuning).

### Webhook and notification network policy

Backup webhooks and outbound notification destinations that can target arbitrary network hosts are restricted by `WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

The allowlist matches exact origins only: scheme, host, and port must match. Paths are ignored, so `https://hooks.example.com/backups` allows any path on `https://hooks.example.com`, but it does not allow `http://hooks.example.com`, `https://hooks.example.com:8443`, or `https://other.example.com`.

This policy applies to:

- backup pre/post webhook URLs
- Generic HTTP notification URLs
- Gotify server URLs
- self-hosted ntfy server URLs
- custom Shoutrrr URLs that point at generic HTTP or SMTP network targets

The public ntfy.sh service and fixed-provider notification services such as Slack, Discord, Pushover, and Telegram do not need `WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

Backup webhooks do not follow redirects. Add the final destination origin to `WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and configure that final URL directly.

Webhook headers are stored as plain text and must use one `Key: Value` header per line. `WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT` controls backup pre/post webhook request timeouts; notification delivery uses the underlying provider sender behavior.

### Provisioned resources

Zerobyte can sync operator-managed repositories and volumes from a JSON file at startup. This is useful when you want credentials or connection details to live in deployment-time configuration instead of being entered through the UI.

Provisioned resources:

- appear in the normal repositories and volumes screens
- can resolve credential fields from environment variables or `/run/secrets/*` during startup sync

The complete provisioning documentation is available at [zerobyte.app/docs/guides/provisioning](https://zerobyte.app/docs/guides/provisioning).

See `examples/provisioned-resources/README.md` for a full example.

### Simplified setup (no remote mounts)

If you only need to back up locally-mounted folders and don't require remote share mounting capabilities, you can remove the `SYS_ADMIN` capability and FUSE device from your `compose.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  zerobyte:
    image: ghcr.io/nicotsx/zerobyte:v0.43
    container_name: zerobyte
    restart: unless-stopped
    stop_grace_period: 30s
    ports:
      - "4096:4096"
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Zurich # Set your timezone here
      - BASE_URL=http://localhost:4096 # Change this to your actual URL (use https:// for secure cookies)
      - APP_SECRET=94bad46...c66e25d5c2b # Generate your own secret with `openssl rand -hex 32`
    volumes:
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      - /var/lib/zerobyte:/var/lib/zerobyte
      - /path/to/your/directory:/mydata
```

**Trade-offs:**

- ✅ Improved security by reducing container capabilities
- ✅ Support for local directories as backup sources
- ✅ Support all repository types, local and remote (S3, GCS, Azure, rclone)
- ❌ Cannot mount NFS, SMB, WebDAV, or SFTP shares directly from Zerobyte

If you need remote mount capabilities, keep the original configuration with `cap_add: SYS_ADMIN` and `devices: /dev/fuse:/dev/fuse`.

## Examples

See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for runnable, copy/paste-friendly examples.

## Adding your first volume

Zerobyte supports multiple volume backends including NFS, SMB, WebDAV, SFTP, and local directories. A volume represents the source data you want to back up and monitor.

To add your first volume, navigate to the "Volumes" section in the web interface and click on "Create volume". Fill in the required details such as volume name, type, and connection settings.

If you want to backup a local directory on the same host where Zerobyte is running, you'll first need to mount that directory into the Zerobyte container. You can do this by adding a volume mapping in your `compose.yaml` file. For example, to mount `/path/to/your/directory` from the host to `/mydata` in the container, you would add the following line under the `volumes` section:

```diff
services:
  zerobyte:
    image: ghcr.io/nicotsx/zerobyte:v0.43
    container_name: zerobyte
    restart: unless-stopped
    stop_grace_period: 30s
    cap_add:
      - SYS_ADMIN
    ports:
      - "4096:4096"
    devices:
      - /dev/fuse:/dev/fuse
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Zurich
      - BASE_URL=http://localhost:4096 # URL you will use to access Zerobyte
      - APP_SECRET=94bad46...c66e25d5c2b # Generate your own secret with `openssl rand -hex 32`
    volumes:
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      - /var/lib/zerobyte:/var/lib/zerobyte
+     - /path/to/your/directory:/mydata
```

After updating the `compose.yaml` file, restart the Zerobyte container to apply the changes:

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

Now, when adding a new volume in the Zerobyte web interface, you can select "Directory" as the volume type and search for your mounted path (e.g., `/mydata`) as the source path.

## Creating a repository

A repository is where your backups will be securely stored encrypted. Zerobyte supports multiple storage backends for your backup repositories:

- **Local directories**: Store backups on local disk subfolders in `/var/lib/zerobyte/repositories/` or any other (mounted) path
- **S3-compatible storage**: Amazon S3, MinIO, Wasabi, DigitalOcean Spaces, etc.
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Google's cloud storage service
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Microsoft Azure storage
- **rclone remotes**: 40+ cloud storage providers via rclone (see below)

Repositories are optimized for storage efficiency and data integrity, leveraging Restic's deduplication and encryption features.

To create a repository, navigate to the "Repositories" section in the web interface and click on "Create repository". Fill in the required details such as repository name, type, and connection settings.

### Using rclone for cloud storage

Zerobyte can use [rclone](https://rclone.org/) to support 40+ cloud storage providers including Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Box, pCloud, Mega, and many more. This gives you the flexibility to store your backups on virtually any cloud storage service.

**Setup instructions:**

1. **Install rclone on your host system** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash
   ```

2. **Configure your cloud storage remote** using rclone's interactive config:

   ```bash
   rclone config
   ```

   Follow the prompts to set up your cloud storage provider. For OAuth providers (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.), rclone will guide you through the authentication flow.

3. **Verify your remote is configured**:

   ```bash
   rclone listremotes
   ```

4. **Mount the rclone config into the Zerobyte container** by updating your `compose.yaml`:

   ```diff
   services:
     zerobyte:
       image: ghcr.io/nicotsx/zerobyte:v0.43
       container_name: zerobyte
       restart: unless-stopped
       stop_grace_period: 30s
       cap_add:
         - SYS_ADMIN
       ports:
         - "4096:4096"
       devices:
         - /dev/fuse:/dev/fuse
       environment:
         - TZ=Europe/Zurich
         - BASE_URL=http://localhost:4096 # URL you will use to access Zerobyte
       volumes:
         - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
         - /var/lib/zerobyte:/var/lib/zerobyte
   +     - ~/.config/rclone:/root/.config/rclone:ro
   ```

   > **Note for non-root users:** If your container runs as a different user (e.g., TrueNAS apps), mount your config to the appropriate location and set `RCLONE_CONFIG_DIR`:
   >
   > ```yaml
   > environment:
   >   - RCLONE_CONFIG_DIR=/home/appuser/.config/rclone
   > volumes:
   >   - ~/.config/rclone:/home/appuser/.config/rclone:ro
   > ```

5. **Restart the Zerobyte container**:

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker compose up -d
   ```

6. **Create a repository** in Zerobyte:
   - Select "rclone" as the repository type
   - Choose your configured remote from the dropdown
   - Specify the path within your remote (e.g., `backups/zerobyte`)

For a complete list of supported providers, see the [rclone documentation](https://rclone.org/).

## Your first backup job

Once you have added a volume and created a repository, you can create your first backup job. A backup job defines the schedule and parameters for backing up a specific volume to a designated repository.

When creating a backup job, you can specify the following settings:

- **Schedule**: Define how often the backup should run (e.g., daily, weekly)
- **Retention Policy**: Set rules for how long backups should be retained (e.g., keep daily backups for 7 days, weekly backups for 4 weeks)
- **Paths**: Specify which files or directories to include in the backup

After configuring the backup job, save it and Zerobyte will automatically execute the backup according to the defined schedule.
You can monitor the progress and status of your backup jobs in the "Backups" section of the web interface.

![Backups UI](https://github.com/nicotsx/zerobyte/blob/main/screenshots/backups-list.png?raw=true)

## Restoring data

Zerobyte allows you to easily restore your data from backups. To restore data, navigate to the "Backups" section and select the backup job from which you want to restore data. You can then choose a specific backup snapshot and select the files or directories you wish to restore. The data you select will be restored to their original location.

![Restore UI](https://github.com/nicotsx/zerobyte/blob/main/screenshots/restoring.png?raw=true)

## Authentication

Zerobyte uses [better-auth](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth) for authentication and session management. The authentication system automatically adapts to your deployment scenario:

### Users and roles

Zerobyte does not currently provide fine-grained RBAC for backup operations. Authenticated organization members are trusted operators for repositories, volumes, backup schedules, restores, and notification destinations in their organization.

Organization roles mainly restrict organization-management and instance-management actions. For example, normal members cannot manage members, SSO settings, invitations, registration, or global users, but they can still operate backup resources. Only add users to an organization if you are comfortable with them using the storage, volume, and notification capabilities configured for the instance.

### Cookie security

- **IP Address/HTTP access**: Set `BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.50:4096` (or your IP). Cookies will use `Secure: false`, allowing immediate login without SSL.
- **Domain/HTTPS access**: Set `BASE_URL=https://zerobyte.example.com`. Cookies will automatically use `Secure: true` for protected sessions.

### Reverse proxy setup

If you're running Zerobyte behind a reverse proxy (Nginx, Traefik, Caddy, etc.):

1. **Set `BASE_URL`** to your HTTPS domain (e.g., `https://zerobyte.example.com`)
2. The app will automatically enable secure cookies based on the `https://` prefix
3. Ensure your proxy passes the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header

### Important notes

- The `BASE_URL` must start with `https://` for secure cookies to be enabled
- Local IP addresses (e.g., `http://192.168.x.x`) are **not** treated as secure contexts by browsers, so secure cookies are disabled automatically
- `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` only allows additional origins for auth-related requests. It does not disable secure cookies or make authenticated HTTP access work when `BASE_URL` is HTTPS.
- If `BASE_URL` is HTTPS, browsers will only send Zerobyte's auth cookies over HTTPS. Plain HTTP access may still show the login page, but authenticated flows will fail because no session cookie is available.

## Contributing

Contributions by anyone are welcome! If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue on GitHub. If you want to contribute code, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. We require that all contributors sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before we can accept your contributions. This is to protect both you and the project.

## Development (no Docker)

With Bun and Portless installed, you can run Zerobyte locally during development without Docker:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

For local development, create a `.env.local` file at the repo root and override the Docker paths:

```bash
# Example
ZEROBYTE_DATABASE_URL=./data/zerobyte.db
APP_SECRET=your_app_secret_here
RESTIC_PASS_FILE=./data/restic.pass
RESTIC_CACHE_DIR=./data/restic/cache
ZEROBYTE_REPOSITORIES_DIR=./data/repositories
ZEROBYTE_VOLUMES_DIR=./data/volumes
BASE_URL=https://*.localhost
```

Notes:

- Remote mount backends (NFS/SMB/WebDAV/SFTP) rely on Linux mount tooling and `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`; on macOS they are expected to be unavailable.
- To actually run backups/repository checks, install `restic` on your machine (e.g., via Homebrew). If `restic` is not installed, the app still starts but backup operations will fail with a clear error.
